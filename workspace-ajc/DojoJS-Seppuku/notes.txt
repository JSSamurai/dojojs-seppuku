NOTE: (Task-4) is very important, upon completion the theme will be well on its way as you will have a color scheme and much of the editor colored. What makes a theme good, or bad, is detail. Though the theme will appear to be complete after (Task-4) has been completed, it will not appear so when it is used rigorously in a actual project, that is being done for actual work, or for a school assignment. It is important that all widgets, menus, syntax highlighting adhere to your color scheme. A half completed theme makes for poor readability, poor highlighting, and it actual makes writing code harder. A perfessional web-designer, application-developer, data-scientist, software engineer ect... ect... needs a really good, really thourough theme, that offers great highlighting and readability.
