# dojojs-seppuku
This is a VS-Code Color Theme. 'DojoJS-Seppuku' is a dark theme that was created to be used for writing JavaScript inside of the VS-Code editor, backend &amp;/or frontend. There is support for CSS, HTML and a few other integrated language-type technologies like JSDocs &amp; Regular Expressions. This theme is professional, it took a long time to for me to get a good enough understanding of the TextMate JSON API tha VSCode uses as its method for theme creation. I made several themes, and used theme for myself before I was comfortable enough to create one for the public. I really enjoy developing anything that lets me play with colors, weather its GUI development, or Theme Building, IMO Gui/Theme development is an art, some people have a knack for it. I worked for quite some time on two themes, this one, and another-one DojoJS-Sunyata, there are thouroughly built, so long as you stick to the languages they support. I will continue to release updates for the themes, that will more thoroughly design every little detail as well as adding support for PHP soon. I Hope you enjoy this theme, feedback is always welcome AndrewChambers.JSSamurai@Gmail.com.
