Seppuku is great theme, maybe I'm boasting a bit, but I do so with confidence, and this is
why. When I first created Seppuku i wasn't calling it Seppuku yet, it was simply Dojo, but
that changed, and Ill tell you why in just a few lines, first I want to point out, quite
honestly, that Dojo was a piece of crap, it was lame, and even worst I was lame for
having created it. As I worked on other projects I would find my self distracted by Dojo.
Whene I was supposed to be creating backend validation methods for applications, I was
working to make Dojo better, it became an obsession, and after several hours every day,
with no days off I finally got Dojo to a place where I was slightly content.

that their are many VSCode themes out there. Still even with all
of the selection, only a few actually offered the readability, syntax highlighting,
beautiful look, and great feel of a theme that could be considered top notch, and
professional.
